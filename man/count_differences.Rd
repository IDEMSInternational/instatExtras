\title{Count Differences Between Two Vectors}
\usage{
count_differences(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector.}

\item{y}{A vector of the same length and type as \code{x}.}
}
\value{
An integer: the number of differing values between \code{x} and \code{y}.
Returns \code{NA_integer_} if \code{x} and \code{y} have different types.
}
\description{
Compares two vectors element-wise and returns the number of differing elements.
Treats \code{NA != value} as a difference and considers \code{NA == NA} as equal.
}
\examples{
count_differences(c(1, 2, NA), c(1, 3, NA))     # 1 difference (2 vs 3)
count_differences(c("a", "b"), c("a", "c"))     # 1 difference
count_differences(c(TRUE, NA), c(TRUE, FALSE)) # 1 difference (NA vs FALSE)

}
